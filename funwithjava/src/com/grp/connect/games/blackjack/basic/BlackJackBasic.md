We will see how to play Blackjack! 
Here are the basic rules of the game:

Blackjack is played with a standard deck of 52 cards.
The goal of the game is to have a hand that is closer to 21 than the dealer's hand, without going over 21.
Each player is dealt two cards, and the dealer is dealt one card face up and one card face down.
Cards 2-10 are worth their face value, face cards (jack, queen, king) are worth 10, and an ace can be worth either 1 or 11, depending on which value would be more beneficial for the player.
After the initial deal, each player can choose to "hit" (take another card) or "stand" (keep their current hand).
Players can continue to hit until they either choose to stand, or their hand exceeds 21 (which results in an automatic loss, known as "busting").
Once all players have completed their turns, the dealer reveals their face-down card and hits until they have a hand of 17 or more. If the dealer's hand exceeds 21, all remaining players win. Otherwise, the player with the hand closest to 21 without going over wins.
There are also some additional rules that can come into play in certain situations, such as splitting pairs, doubling down, or taking insurance. However, these rules can vary depending on the specific version of Blackjack being played, so it's always a good idea to familiarize yourself with the rules of the game you'll be playing before getting started.

Using above rules , We will now write a Java program that simulates a 2 player game of Blackjack using the rules we discussed earlier. Here is a basic outline of how you could structure your program:

Create a deck of cards by initializing an array or ArrayList of all 52 cards. Each card should have a suit and a value.
Shuffle the deck of cards using a random number generator.
Deal two cards to each player, alternating between the players.
Calculate the value of each player's hand by adding up the point values of their cards. Remember that aces can be worth either 1 or 11, depending on which value is more advantageous.
Allow the players to take turns hitting or standing, starting with the first player. Each time a player hits, deal them another card and recalculate the value of their hand.
If either player's hand exceeds 21, they automatically lose (or "bust").
Once both players have chosen to stand, or one player has busted, reveal the dealer's face-down card and continue hitting until the dealer's hand is worth 17 or more.
Determine the winner by comparing the value of each player's hand to the dealer's hand. The player with the hand closest to 21 without going over wins. If the dealer busts, all remaining players win.
